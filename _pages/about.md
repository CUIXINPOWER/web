Xin Cui received the B.Sc. degree in electrical engineering from Qinghai University, China, in 2016, and the M.Sc. degree in electrical engineering from Tsinghua University, China, in 2020. I am currently pursuing the Ph.D degree at Hong Kong University. My main research interests are planning and operation of coupled power system and transportation system, high impedance faults detection in power distribution networks.
